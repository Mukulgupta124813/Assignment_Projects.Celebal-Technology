# Celebal Technology - Completed Assignments

Welcome to the repository containing completed assignments by Celebal Technology! In this repository, you will find the solutions and code implementations for four different assignments provided by Celebal Technology. Each project is designed to test and enhance various skills, making it an exciting learning journey.

## Assignments

1. **Assignment 1: Best Classification Algorithm **
   Description: In this assignment, I Performed classification Algorithms on the provided dataset. Its working with involves cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data using popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn and classification Algorithm from the Sklearn library.

2. **Assignment 2: Object Detection with YOLOv8 **
   Description: In this assignment, using YOLOv8, I successfully developed a robust and efficient model capable of detecting Holes in the road. The task at hand was crucial for improving road safety and infrastructure maintenance. YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, proved to be an excellent choice for this application due to its real-time capabilities and accuracy.

3. **Assignment 3: Sentiment Analysis **
   Description: This assignment delves into the world of Natural Language Processing. It contains using NLP libraries like NLTK and its functionality like stopwords, etc and a naive Bayes algorithm to create the model. The knowledge gained from this assignment can be applied to various real-world applications, such as social media sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and market sentiment tracking.

4. **Assignment 4: Time Series and Forecasting **
   Description: In this assignment, I embarked on a fascinating journey of using the SARIMAX algorithm to forecast future sales. As the sales data is inherently time-dependent, employing time series analysis techniques seemed like a natural choice to gain valuable insights and make informed predictions. It also involves data importing, cleaning, and calculating the p, d, and q values for choosing the algorithm between ARIMAX and SARIMAx.
